# Digital-connections-workshop

Code for lyall to use, for short workshop on fun with arduino+processing+skype.

'Trigger' runs on the one mac, whilst the 'client' runs on the other mac. Create a skype call between the two macs. If you've correctly routed the sound output* to skype, the sound will go over the skype call, which will trigger the LED on the client mac (which has an Arduino plugged in).

Note the Arduino code is located in the client processing sketch. Copy it (without the '*/' and '/*' - those are comment blocks)

*You'll need soundflower to route audio around apps https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/

Once you've install soundflower, adjust your sound settings to match the below images (don't forget to change them back afterwards):
